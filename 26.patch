+# Chromium for Wayland
 
-Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster,
-and more stable way for all users to experience the web.
+NOTE: All the work has moved to the Chromium mainline repository. This repo is being
+updated on a weekly basis and some patches may land here first. This is not a fork, but
+rather a downstream branch for first round reviews.
 
-The project's web site is https://www.chromium.org.
+The goal of this project is to enable
+[Chromium browser](https://www.chromium.org/) to run on
+[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/). Note that contrary to
+[01.org/ozone-wayland](https://github.com/01org/ozone-wayland), the idea is
+to keep it very close to upstream developments as well as aligned on Google's own
+plans. In particular, this fork is rebased against
+[Chromium ToT](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git) each week
+and patches are upstreamed as soon as possible.
+
+The implementation also relies on actively developed Chromium technologies:
+
+* [Aura](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/aura/aura-overview) for the user interface and windowing.
+* [Ozone](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ozone_overview.md) as a platform abstraction layer together with the [upstream Wayland backend](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/ui/ozone/platform/wayland/).
+* [Mojo](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/mojo) to perform IPC communication.
+
+Notice that the effort done here is also useful to run Chromium with Ozone on
+Linux Desktop for X11/Wayland.

+# What is Chromium browser?

+
+[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster,
+and more stable way for all users to experience the Web.
 
 Documentation in the source is rooted in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

+
+# Building Chromium
+
+General information is provided by the upstream documentation for
+[Chromium on Linux](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_build_instructions.md)
+and
+[Ozone](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ozone_overview.md).
+Here is the summary of commands to build and run Chrome for Wayland:
+
+```
+gn args out/Ozone --args="use_ozone=true use_xkbcommon=true use_system_minigbm=true"
+ninja -C out/Ozone chrome
+./out/Ozone/chrome --ozone-platform=wayland
+
+Please note that Ozone/Wayland also supports GpuMemoryBuffers and in order to enable them, the --enable-native-gpu-buffers must be passed.
+
+Note that GN defaults to debug builds, which naturally take longer to finish and produce slower binaries at runtime. The 'is_debug=false' GN arguments disables it.
+
+Also note that some touch oriented Web pages like Google Maps, work better when the Touch Event API is explicitly enabled
+in chrome://flags or a command line argument --touch-events=enabled is passed.
+
+It is also possible to enable proprietary codecs (so that mp4, h264 medias play) with the following GN args: 'proprietary_codecs=true ffmpeg_branding=\"Chrome\"'.
+```
+
+By default, the `headless`, `x11` and `wayland` Ozone backends are
+compiled and X11 is selected when `--ozone-platform` is not specified.
+Please refer to the
+[GN Configuration notes](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ozone_overview.md#GN-Configuration-notes) for details on how to change
+that behavior.
+
+# Running Tests
+
+To be added.
+
+# Rebase Strategy
+
+The fork is rebased every week against Chromium ToT.
+The goal is to be as close as possible to the latest code, which is
+constantly receiving performance and stability fixes.
+
+Here is the current process:
+
+* Every week, a member of the Igalia Chromium team takes the rebase shift.
+
+* Commits that are complementary of each other, receive a "fixup!" prefix on
+the commit title, and keep the rest of original commit title unchanged.
+
+For example:
+
+```
+$ git log --oneline
+commit 1
+commit 2
+commit 3
+fixup! commit 1
+fixup! commit 2
+commit 4
+fixup! commit 2
+(..)
+```
+
+This allows an easy identification of "fixup" commits, which should be squashed into
+their original counterpart commit as part of the next rebase cycle. That way we keep
+our Git history clean, and commits as atomic as possible, for when upstreaming.
+
+Git has [an optimized flow for this](http://fle.github.io/git-tip-keep-your-branch-clean-with-fixup-and-autosquash.html) as well.
+
+* We always keep the 'ozone-wayland-dev' branch as our primarily development branch.
+
+This means that force pushes will happen. So every time one of the team members
+rebases our branch, the developer should first back up the existing ozone-wayland-dev
+browser, with the following naming: ozone-wayland-dev-rXXXX, where XXXX is the respective
+Chromium baseline of the branch.
+
+* Branch acceptance criteria
+
+Make sure that the patches meet the [coding style](https://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style) criteria.
+
+* Keep [our internal buildbot](https://build-chromium.igalia.com/) green.
